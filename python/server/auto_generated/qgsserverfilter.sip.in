class QgsServerFilter
{
%Docstring
Class defining I/O filters for QGIS Server and
implemented in plugins.

Filters can define any (or none) of the following hooks:

- :py:func:`~requestReady` - called when request is ready
- :py:func:`~responseComplete` - called when the response is complete after core services have returned to main loop
- :py:func:`~sendResponse` - called just before sending output to FGCI
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgsserverfilter.h"
%End
  public:

    QgsServerFilter( QgsServerInterface *serverInterface );
%Docstring
Constructor
:py:class:`QgsServerInterface` passed to plugins constructors
and must be passed to QgsServerFilter instances.
%End

    virtual ~QgsServerFilter();

    QgsServerInterface *serverInterface();
%Docstring
Returns the :py:class:`QgsServerInterface` instance
%End

    virtual void requestReady();
%Docstring
Method called when the :py:class:`QgsRequestHandler` is ready and populated with
parameters, just before entering the main switch for core services.
%End

    virtual void responseComplete();
%Docstring
Method called when the :py:class:`QgsRequestHandler` processing has done and
the response is ready, just after the main switch for core services
and before final sending response to FCGI stdout.
%End

    virtual void sendResponse();
%Docstring
Method called when the :py:class:`QgsRequestHandler` sends its data to FCGI stdout.
This normally occurs at the end of core services processing just after
the :py:func:`~QgsServerFilter.responseComplete` plugin hook. For streaming services (like WFS on
getFeature requests, :py:func:`~QgsServerFilter.sendResponse` might have been called several times
before the response is complete: in this particular case, :py:func:`~QgsServerFilter.sendResponse`
is called once for each feature before hitting :py:func:`~QgsServerFilter.responseComplete`
%End
